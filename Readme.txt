Scale widget 

This is a plugin used for scaling the image and maintain the aspect ratio, independent of the image width and height.

How to use this ?

Including the javaScript file.
You can scale the object by calling the scale widget function with the parent ID / CLASS.
Ex: $("#scale-widget").scaleWidget();

More explanation on this plugin, and updates will be pushed shortly.

==============================
In my second release, branch name - release_2_0109

If the parent ID / CLASS has margin for the widget, then issues pertaining to aspect ratio has been fixed.


Thanks.
